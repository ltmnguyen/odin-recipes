    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            On a hot day in Japan, a bowl of cold soba noodles is the perfect meal or snack. Soba noodles are brown noodles made of wheat and  
            buckwheat. They can be stirfried or flash boiled and served cold. Cold soba noodles are usually served with a dipping sauce. The 
            dipping sauce is a dashi-based sauce, which is a common base in Japanese cuisine. These noodles can be cooked and served with any 
            topping, but they are also perfect with just the dipping sauce.
